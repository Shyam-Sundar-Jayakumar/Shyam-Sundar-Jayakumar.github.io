I am a master's student in the Department of [Aerospace Engineering] at [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]. Interested in Multiphase flows and turbulence. I am currently learning about modelling multiphase flows and analysisng the data obtained from the simulations and experiments.

**My interests:**
* Computational Fluid Dynamics
* UAV aerodynamics and flight mechanics
* Control systems
