## SAE Aero Design Challenge

* Highlights:
  * Design of fixed wing RC Plane for payload carrying mission using CATIA.
  * CFD Analysis on the plane to estimate its aerodynamic forces and structural integrity using Ansys. 
  * Development of the plane for real life testing with appropriate component selection
  * Placed 'Top 13' in the SAE Aero Design Challenge conducted in India and second in our region

##### Research process

The RC Plane was specifically built for payload carrying, so the design parameters were estimated with keeping that factor as the top priority.


* To begin with, conceptual design of the RC Plane was generated using [CATIA] with the estimated design parameters such as wingspan, fuselage length, control surface dimesions and so on.

_CFD analysis of the plane_

* To validate the analytical calculations, CFD simulations were initiated to validate the lift and drag produced by the plane, as it is designed to lift a payload upto 4-6 Kilograms.

* The validations of the CFD outcomes were upright and the project proceeded for the fabrication of the plane.
* Initially, the spars of the wings were laser cut and the fuselage was made from aluminum struts. Brief of the fabrication is provided in the video.
